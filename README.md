## Installation

To get started with the application, simply clone the project and run "npm install" on your command line after navigating to your repository. Then, all you have to do is run "npm start" and the localhost port will be logged to your command line.

## Usage

You can use this application to create, view, and delete notes to keep thoughts organized and never forget about an idea.

A user can easily create a new note by clicking the pencil icon in the top right corner. Once notes have been added to the application, they can be accessed by selecting a note from the content bar on the left. The notes are persistent, so even after a (local) session stops, the application will load the already saved notes from the backend. The application also welcomes the user by displaying the most recently added note instead of a blank screen. A note can be deleted by clicking the trashcan icon next to the name of the note in the left column.
